=> My Takeaway:

    - FastAPI is a python framework p much like Flash and Django to create APIs using python 
    - Flask API has gained popularity due to its ability to support Asynchronous Functionality and easy Code refactoring
    - It has Pdantic which allows auto validation of requests

    - Installed FastAPI and uvicorn 
    - Implemented a Site as in "FastAPI01.py" that displays a Welcome Message
